# TKey-android-loader
!!This is a WIP. Certain features and functions (such as signing and verifying) have not yet been implemented/are not fully functional!!

This is a simple app that allows one to load apps onto the [Tillitis TKey](tillitis.se) using an Android device, as well as sign files and verify the TKey.
